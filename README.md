# - üìè - Mock Portfolio- üé® -

I was given this challenge as a way to recreate a website using only a Figma file from another user.
The Figma file was designed simply with instructions to be thoroughly detailed on what colors, spacing, and symbols to use. To make it unique, I made it to use myself as the client who will receive this website by adding my information.

I aimed to follow the instructions and complete the project accurately to color design and responsiveness. Included I will provide the example I had to follow
