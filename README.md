# - üìè - Mock Portfolio- üé® -

I was given this challenge as a way to recreate a website using only Figma file from another user.
The Figma file was designed simply with instructions to be thouroughly detailed on what colors, spacing and symbols to use. To make it unique, I made it to use myself as the client who will receive this website by adding my information.

My goal was to follow the instructions and complete the project with high accuracy to color, design and responsiveness. Included I will provide the exmaple I had to follow
